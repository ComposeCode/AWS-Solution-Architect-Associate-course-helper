### What are availability Zones?

AWS is made available globally across the world. Each location AWS is available is split into regions and availability zones. Each region is a separate geographic area. Each region has multiple, isolated locations, known as availability zones (they usually have 2 or more availability zones).

Simply put: an availability zone (AZ) is a data center. There are currently 14 regions with 38 availability zones.
