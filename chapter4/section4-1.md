# Chapter 4, Section 1: EC2 Introduction

### What is EC2?

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. Amazon Ec2 reduces the time required to obtain and boo new server instances to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity, both up and down, as your computing requirements change.

Amazon EC2 changes the economics of computing by allowing you to pay only for capacity that you actually use. Amazon EC2 provides developers the tools to build failure resilient applications and isolate themselves from common failure scenarios.

- Virtual Machines, on demand.

## EC2 - Options

- on Demand - allow you to pay a fixed rate by the hour with no commitment.
- Reserved - provide you with a capacity reservation, and offer a significant discount on the hourly charge for an instance. 1 Year or 3 Year Terms.
- Spot, enable you to bid whatever price you want for instance capacity, providing for even greater savings if your applications have flexible start and end times.
- Dedicated Hosts - Physical EC2 server dedicated for your use. Dedicated Hosts can help you reduce costs by allow you to use your existing server-bound software licenses.

## On Demand

- Users that want the low cost and flexibility of Amazon EC2 without any up-front payment or long-term commitment.
- Applications with short term, spiky or unpredictable workloads that cannot be interrupted.
- Applications being developed or tested on Amazon EC2 for the first time.
